# Group 12: Ankur Pandey (pandea23), Karanveer Sandhu (sandhk20)

## Work done by each member:

### Ankur Pandey

- Handled the MMU - Address Translation part [15 marks]. Additionally handled some part of the TLB inclusion in our MMU [10 Marks].

### Karanveer Sandhu

- Handled the Handling Page Faults part [15 Marks]. Additionally handled some part of the TLB inclusion in our MMU [10 Marks].

We both equally helped each other out and were on the same page while solving this assignment. We each handled a separate 15 mark part on our own (MMU and Page faults were 15 marks each which we handled separately). Additionally, we worked together to incorporate the TLB data structure in our MMU. Therefore according to our arbitrary calculation, the work was split 50-50 between us.
